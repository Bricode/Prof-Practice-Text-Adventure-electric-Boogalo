The Steel port town border stretches before you.
To the north, the tall trees of the Steel port national park stand dark and foreboding.
To the south, the first of the finished steelport apartment complexes looms tall. 
An aluminium sign points north with the words "steel port labratory" in white, 
however part of the sign has had the word "MURDERERS" spray painted onto its surface.
