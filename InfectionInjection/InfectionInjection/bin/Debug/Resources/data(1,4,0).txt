To the west, the Steel port apartment complex towers over you.
None of the undead that shamble around its base have noticed you yet.
To approach any closer without a weapon would be a death sentence.
To the south you can see that the small line of family owned stores trail 
off at the edge of town. They all appear to have been thoroughly looted.
